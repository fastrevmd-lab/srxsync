# srxsync

Keep a fleet of Juniper SRX firewalls in sync with a designated master SRX.
Reads selected configuration sections from the master and pushes them to a
list of target devices, with safety rails (`commit confirmed`), drift
detection, and per-target include lists.

Design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-srxsync-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-srxsync-design.md)

## Install

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Optional extras:

```
pip install -e .[keyring]   # OS keyring secret provider
pip install -e .[vault]     # HashiCorp Vault secret provider
pip install -e .[rust]      # rustez NETCONF backend (selectable via --transport rustez)
```

Python 3.11+ required.

## Quickstart

1. Write an inventory file (`inv.yaml`):

    ```yaml
    source:
      host: srx-master.example.net
      auth: { provider: env }

    targets:
      - host: srx-site-a.example.net
        auth: { provider: env }
        include: [objects, policies, nat, qos, zones]
      - host: srx-site-b.example.net
        auth: { provider: env }
        include: [policies, nat]
    ```

    Each target's `include:` explicitly lists the categories it will receive —
    no top-level default, no implicit inheritance. Read the inventory and you
    know exactly what every device gets.

2. Provide credentials out-of-band (see [Secrets](#secrets)):

    ```
    export SRX_USER_SRX_MASTER_EXAMPLE_NET=srxsync
    export SRX_SSH_KEY_SRX_MASTER_EXAMPLE_NET=~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    # repeat per target host
    ```

3. Check first:

    ```
    srxsync check --inventory inv.yaml --verbose
    ```

4. Push (always commit-confirmed by default):

    ```
    srxsync push --inventory inv.yaml --merge --commit-confirmed 5
    ```

## CLI

```
srxsync push  --inventory inv.yaml (--replace | --merge)
              [--commit-confirmed N] [--max-parallel N]
              [--on-error continue|abort] [--dry-run]
              [--transport {pyez,rustez}]

srxsync check --inventory inv.yaml [--verbose] [--transport {pyez,rustez}]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--replace` / `--merge` | Mutually exclusive. `--replace` annotates each category root with `replace="replace"` so Junos wipes slave-specific siblings within synced subtrees. `--merge` only adds/updates. |
| `--commit-confirmed N` | Commit with an N-minute auto-rollback timer; srxsync calls `commit` again to seal. Default: 5. |
| `--max-parallel N` | Concurrent target workers. Default: 5. |
| `--on-error continue\|abort` | On a per-target failure, continue (exit non-zero at end) or cancel remaining work. Default: continue. |
| `--dry-run` | Fetch source + compute per-target payload, print what would change, do not load or commit. |
| `--verbose` (check only) | Show per-category XML diff for drifted targets. |
| `--transport {pyez,rustez}` | NETCONF backend. `pyez` (default) is junos-eznc; `rustez` is the Rust-backed client (install with `pip install -e .[rust]`). Both produce identical results; `rustez` is faster for large fleets. |

Exit 0 only when every target succeeded (push) or is in sync (check).

## Categories

Synced scope is defined in [`srxsync/data/categories.yaml`](srxsync/data/categories.yaml):

| Category | Junos paths |
|---|---|
| `objects` | `security address-book`, `applications` |
| `policies` | `security policies` |
| `nat` | `security nat` |
| `qos` | `class-of-service` |
| `zones` | `security zones` (interfaces pruned — device-specific) |

**Excluded from sync:** `interfaces`, `routing-options`, `protocols`, `system`,
`chassis`, and zone-to-interface bindings. These are device-specific and
never cross-synced.

### Adding a new category

Adding NTP, SNMP, or anything else is a YAML edit, not a code change. Append
to `srxsync/data/categories.yaml`:

```yaml
ntp:
  paths:
    - /configuration/system/ntp
```

Then add `ntp` to the `include:` list of whichever targets should receive it.

## Secrets

Credentials never live in the inventory file. `auth.provider` selects a
`SecretProvider`:

| Provider | Reads |
|---|---|
| `env` | `SRX_USER_<HOST>`, `SRX_PASSWORD_<HOST>` or `SRX_SSH_KEY_<HOST>` (tilde-expanded path). Host dots and dashes become underscores. |
| `netrc` | `~/.netrc` entry matching `machine <host>` |
| `keyring` | OS keyring slot `srxsync/<auth.key>`, stored as `username:password` |
| `vault` | HashiCorp Vault path `auth.path`, `VAULT_ADDR` + `VAULT_TOKEN` env |

Example env-var wiring for `srx-a.example.net`:

```
export SRX_USER_SRX_A_EXAMPLE_NET=srxsync
export SRX_SSH_KEY_SRX_A_EXAMPLE_NET=~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

## Safety

1. **No partial commits.** Every `load` is paired with `commit confirmed` +
   `confirm`. Script crash or network drop between them → the SRX
   auto-rolls back after the timer expires.
2. **Per-target isolation.** One target's failure never affects another
   (separate `Transport` instances per worker).
3. **Best-effort cleanup.** On exception, `rollback()` + `close()` run;
   cleanup errors are swallowed so the original error is preserved.
4. **Honest exit code.** Exit 0 only if every target reported success;
   `--on-error continue` does not mask failures.

## Testing

Two layers, no device mocks.

```
pytest tests/unit/            # pure logic against XML fixtures
pytest tests/integration/     # real vSRX lab (skipped if tests/lab.yaml missing)
```

### Lab setup

Copy `tests/lab.yaml.example` to `tests/lab.yaml` (gitignored) and fill in
three vSRX hosts (one master + two slaves). Export credentials per host, or
set the defaults once:

```
export SRXSYNC_LAB_USER=srxsync
export SRXSYNC_LAB_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

The lab tests exercise the full pipeline — drift detection, merge sync,
`--replace` wipe, and commit-confirmed auto-rollback. Every test is
parametrized over both transports (`pyez` and `rustez`) when the `[rust]`
extra is installed; rustez cases are skipped cleanly otherwise. The
commit-confirmed test waits 75 seconds for the Junos rollback timer, so
expect ~3–4 minutes for a full integration run across both backends.

## Architecture

```
CLI → Orchestrator → (CategoryModel, DiffBuilder, DriftDetector, Transport)
                      │                                            │
                      └──── SecretProvider (env/netrc/keyring/vault)
```

- **CategoryModel** (`categories.py`) — loads `data/categories.yaml`,
  resolves category names → paths + prune rules.
- **DiffBuilder** (`diff.py`) — extracts source subtrees, applies prune
  rules, annotates replace-mode category roots.
- **DriftDetector** (`drift.py`) — canonical XML compare of source vs
  target within the synced scope.
- **Transport** (`transport/base.py`) — abstract; two concrete backends
  selected at runtime via `--transport`:
  - `PyEZTransport` (`transport/pyez.py`) — junos-eznc, default.
  - `RustezTransport` (`transport/rustez.py`) — Rust-backed via
    [rustez](https://github.com/fastrevmd-lab/rustEZ) + rustnetconf,
    gated by the `[rust]` extra. Integration tests parametrize both
    backends so parity is enforced.
- **Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`) — async semaphore-capped fanout,
  per-target category resolution and lifecycle (`connect → load → commit
  confirmed → confirm → close`), `--on-error` handling, aggregate exit code.
  Master is fetched once with the union of all target includes.
